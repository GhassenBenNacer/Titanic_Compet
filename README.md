# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains my first attempt at solving the Titanic dataset classification problem. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, and class.

## Models Used

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

I implemented a Support Vector Machine classifier to predict survival outcomes. The code is in the `svm_model.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

### Random Forest Classifier

The Random Forest Classifier is another model I explored for this classification task. The code is available in the `random_forest_model.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

### Neural Network with PyTorch

For a more advanced approach, I experimented with a neural network using PyTorch. The neural network model is implemented in the `neural_network_model.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-dataset-analysis.git

## Improvements
This is my first submission for the Titanic dataset, and there is room for improvement, especially in the neural network model. Possible enhancements include:

Tuning hyperparameters for better performance.
Feature engineering to extract more meaningful information.
Experimenting with different neural network architectures.
Feel free to contribute or provide suggestions for improvement.
